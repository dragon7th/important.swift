The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in the US, and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.

Here's a breakdown of the "Luhn formula problem," which essentially means how to determine if a given number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm:

**How the Luhn Algorithm Works:**

1.  **From right to left, double every second digit.** If doubling a digit results in a two-digit number (i.e., greater than 9), subtract 9 from the result (or, equivalently, add the two digits of the result together).  For example, 8 doubled is 16, and 16 - 9 = 7, or 1 + 6 = 7.
2.  **Sum all the digits** (including the digits that were not doubled).
3.  **If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0** (that is, the total ends in zero), then the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.

**Example:**

Let's say we want to validate the number 79927398713.

1.  **Double every second digit from right to left:**
    *   3 -> 6
    *   1 -> 2
    *   8 -> 16 (16 - 9 = 7)
    *   3 -> 6
    *   7 -> 14 (14 - 9 = 5)
    *   9 -> 18 (18 - 9 = 9)

2.  **Sum all digits (including the doubled ones):**
    7 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 6 = 71

3.  **Check if the total modulo 10 is 0:**
    71 mod 10 = 1

Since the result is not 0, the number 79927398713 is *not* valid according to the Luhn algorithm.

**The "Luhn Formula Problem"**

The "Luhn formula problem" usually refers to one of these tasks:

*   **Validating a number:** Given a number, determine if it's a valid Luhn number.
*   **Generating a valid number:** Given a partial number, calculate the check digit that would make the complete number valid according to the Luhn algorithm. This is often used when generating new identification numbers.

In summary, the Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum method to help detect common errors in entered or stored identification numbers. The "Luhn formula problem" involves either validating a number or generating a valid check digit.
