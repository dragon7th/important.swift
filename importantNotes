.enumerated() is a method in Swift that transforms the marineFord 
array into a sequence of (index, value) pairs. Essentially, 
it adds an index to each element in the array. For example, 
marineFord.enumerated() would produce something like:
 [(0, "Garp"), (1, "Kizaru"), (2, "Lava man")].

struct Singer {
    var name = "The Pantura's"
}

var singer1 = Singer()
var singer2 = singer1

singer2.name = "Feel Koplo"
print(singer1.name)
print(singer2.name)

// it will print 
The Pantura's
Feel Koplo

class Singer {
    var name = "The Pantura's"
}

var singer1 = Singer()
var singer2 = singer1

singer2.name = "Feel Koplo"
print(singer1.name)
print(singer2.name)

// it will print
Feel Koplo
Feel Koplo
